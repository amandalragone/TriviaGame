This is a Trivia Game about movies and TV series. Players will need to answer 10 questions, one at a time.

Each question allows 30 seconds for the player to guess the correct answer. As soon as the player chooses an option, the clock will stop and the player will see which answer was the correct one. If the clock reaches 0, the player will still see a screen containing the question status,however, the question will count as unanswered.

In the end, the player will see how many questions were correct, how many were incorrect, and how many were unanswered. The player can then re-start the game.
